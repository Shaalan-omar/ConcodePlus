			Code generation is a very important in our current daily life. However, the documentation of the code is beyond important too,
      we need the code that is generated to have a documentation generated with it in order to be able to generate a code that is understandable
      and increase the efficency (we increase the efficency of the code by providing commented code, so it will be easier to understand and reuse or extract the 
       needed parts from it)

        <h2 class="mt-5">Dataset</h2>

        <p>
			Our initial plan was to work with the Cocode's task dataset (concode is the code generation task), this was initially our intution
      as our task, ConcodePlus(the commented code generation task), was going to generate the code that concode generated but with comments. However,
      in concode's dataset we only had the code and the Natural Language describing the code, but no dataset had the code itself with comments in the same coloumn,
      this of course limited our ways 
      to train the model on genreating a documented code, as we had no clear dataset that had code, comments for that code, all we had was datasets having code and 
      a natural language describing the code, as illustrated in the visualization of the Concode's dataset below.

    </div>
    <br/> <!-- Empty Line after the image -->
<p>
  Hence, we had to make a major change, that will allow us to have a dataset that contains a pair consisting of code and a prompt as usual describing 
      the code, but in the code's column we added comments to the code itself in the same coloumn.
      This was our own dataset, and we called PyPlus, as this dataset works on Python codes only, and the plus part is because it is the first of its 
      type to contain code with detailed comments of the code in the same column, or at least the first 
      of its type as an open source dataset, as we have found NO other open source or closed source (but this is hard to make sure of as closed source
      are like a black box, you cannot see what is inside them) dataset in python storing data in that way.

        <p>
			Parsel is an Open AI deep learning project, it has been the state of the art in the field of code generation task aloong with code summrization as shown below in the tables and the graphs.
      It is based on the GPT architecture (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), the version of Parsel mentioned in the tables below is the 1.5B, which refers to the larges Parsel version
      existing as it uses 1.5 Billion parameters. 
      Even though it is a open source, the usage of Open AI APIs limited our usage and the freedom of adding our creativity.

        <h2 class="mt-5">Orignial Model from Literature.</h2>

        <p>
			Our model, CodeT5, has 3 main versions. The small, base, and big. The small has 60 million parameters, the big has 770 million parameters and the base version, which we worked with is 220 million parameters.
      We started with the smal version due to our limitations on Google Colab, which made it very hard to work with versions that had larger size from the parameters prespective. However, due to reaching bad results 
      as explained in our previous presentations, we had to find a way around to use the base version. Using the base version worked more than fine, and we reached the desired output as shown above. Please find below
      more details about the original codeT5 model.
